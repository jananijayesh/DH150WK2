# Usability Evaluation and Testing

The purpose of the UT was to highlight the how the design of the sketch London website is not minimalist and provides too many distractions that take away from the purpose of the site, doesnâ€™t portray an accurate visual representation of what is in there, and prompts some uneasiness and forces users to recall some information, which were all found in the heuristic evaluation.

All in all, it's safe to say that the UT testing gave me a really good and deep insight into the user experience of using the sketch London website. Since the heuristic evaluation was only done by me, I hadn't looked at other aspects which bothered other people about the website. Now after doing this, I am considering redoing my heuristic evaluation, because I may have ignored some aspects of the wesbite. the UT was carried out smoothly using Quicktime Player, and the participant seemed to have a good amount of experience in dealing with restaurant websites, although he had never used this website before. Looking back, I preferred having a first-time user test the website, as I got more honest feedback.
